# EigoPropo
**AI proposal generator for non-native freelance developers (Upwork / Fiverr)**

Clients decide fast—often on mobile.
EigoPropo generates **short, client-ready English proposals** using your profile (skills / role / tone / timezone).

✅ Built from real experience: **100+ proposals as a freelancer + reviewed proposals as a client**  
✅ Typical flow: **30–60 min → ~1 min** (generate + optional translation)  
✅ No rewriting. No prompt engineering.

## Why I built this
I sent **100+ proposals as a freelancer**, then reviewed proposals **as a client**.
Most proposals are never fully read.
Clients decide within the first few lines.

So instead of teaching how to write proposals,
I built a tool that **reduces wasted effort** in proposal writing.

## How it works (under ~1 minute)
1) Log in  
2) Set your profile once (skills, role, tone, timezone)  
3) Paste the job description (copy & paste as-is)  
4) Generate proposal  
5) (Optional) Translate for review / sharing  
6) Save & reuse from the dashboard

## Key features
### 1) Structure clients actually read
Proposals follow a clear structure:
- What you will do
- When it will be delivered
- (Optional) Price — **OFF by default**

### 2) Price is OFF by default
On Upwork, clients usually see budget separately.
Price inclusion is optional and OFF by default to avoid accidental over-disclosure.

### 3) Tone control (actually different)
Choose how you sound:
- Friendly — warm, conversational
- Professional — clear, business-focused
- Direct — straight to the point

### 4) Built for non-native English developers
Your proposals are generated using:
your skills, experience, tone, and timezone
→ English that sounds natural, not translated.

### 5) One-click translation (optional)
Translate the English proposal into:
- Japanese
- Vietnamese
- Indonesian
- Thai

### 6) Timezone bar
Shows your local time and overlaps (US / Europe / Asia)
to help set deadlines and expectations.

### 7) Proposal dashboard
View past proposals, reopen & edit, copy, re-translate, and reuse structure.
No more starting from zero.

## Who this is for
- Non-native English web developers
- Freelancers using Upwork / Fiverr
- Developers who hate writing proposals
- People who want faster applications, not longer ones
- Those who understand that structure beats wording

## What this is NOT
- Not a “learn English” app
- Not a generic AI chat tool
- Not a proposal template dump  
It’s a workflow tool, not a writing lesson.
